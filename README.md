This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based machine learning model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.

KNN is a distance-based supervised learning algorithm that classifies a new data point by looking at the majority class of its nearest neighbors in the training dataset.
